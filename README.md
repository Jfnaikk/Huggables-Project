# Huggables-Project
uggable is a connected body pillow that recreates the sensation of your loved one's hug. It senses heart rate, breathing, and body temperature, transmitting these in real-time for a warm, comforting embrace. The connection works both ways, letting you share each other's presence across any distance.
